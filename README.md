## 🧾 Expense Tracker Web App

This is a user-friendly Expense Tracker built with **Flask**, **SQLite**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It allows users to securely register, log in, and manage their personal spending with categorized entries. Users can:

- ➕ Add new expenses with location, amount, and timestamp  
- 🔍 View a list of recorded transactions  
- 🗑️ Delete specific entries  
- 📊 Calculate total expenses filtered by day, month, or year  
- 🧑‍💼 Maintain separate data for each logged-in user  

All data is stored locally in a SQLite database. The application uses Flask sessions for user authentication and provides flash messages for real-time feedback. It’s lightweight, intuitive, and a great starting point for full-stack web development using Python.
